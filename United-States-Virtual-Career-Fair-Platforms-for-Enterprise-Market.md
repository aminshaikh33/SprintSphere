Additionally, the integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in some platforms offers an immersive experience for candidates and hiring managers alike, transforming the way job seekers interact with employers during virtual career fairs. Another trend is the growing emphasis on candidate experience and engagement. Companies are increasingly focusing on providing personalized, interactive experiences for attendees during virtual career fairs. Features such as live chats, video booths, and on-demand content allow candidates to engage with employers in real-time and learn about company culture, job openings, and career development opportunities.
